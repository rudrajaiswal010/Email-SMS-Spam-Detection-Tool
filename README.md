# Email-SMS-Spam-Detection-Tool
 SMS/Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting spam messages (SMS or Email) using machine learning algorithms. It classifies messages into spam or ham (not spam) based on their content.

 Features
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Classification using ML models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

 Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

NLTK / spaCy (for NLP)

Jupyter Notebook

 Dataset
Public dataset like SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI)

 Usage
Clone the repo

Install dependencies

Run the notebook / script

Input a message to get spam prediction

 Future Improvements
Use deep learning (LSTM/RNN)

Deploy as a web or mobile app

Add support for real-time message classification
